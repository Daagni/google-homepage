From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Project is to make an html that replicates the google home page with a search bar form, how to center elements horizontally, how to find image urls using devolper tools thru chrome, how to move divisions and arrange them, how to identify background colors, and how to include css in your page.

The replica does not have to submit the data to any back end server etc.  Also a good refresher on how to use cmd line(git) in linux to make your README, html, and css files for this project.
